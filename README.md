Sample Setup for configuring java agent 

Related custom-activity-correlation.xml files are kept at home locations which is used by java agent to insert custom correlation header at client and similar config is used by server to read it 

This helps agent in detecting continuous BT flow and call graph is created accordingly with drill down option at client end giving an option to drill down to downstream call graphs etc.
